### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kirill Kolodiaznyi and I'm a software developer from Ukraine, living in Kharkiv. You can find me on [Twitter][1],  or on [LinkedIn][3].

## ðŸ”¬ Research & Intersest
My current sphere of interest includes mostly Machine Learning, Computer vision and roboics projects.
The recent projects I'm working on are:
- [Porting LoFTR feature matching model to low-end devices](https://github.com/Kolkir/Coarse_LoFTR_TRT)
- [Implementation of robotic platform based on NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2Gb device with monocular SLAM navigation](https://github.com/Kolkir/rosbot)


## &#x270d; Writing
Apart of coding I also write articles and wrote a book.
- [Polynomial regression with XTensor library tutorial](https://github.com/Kolkir/mlcpp/tree/master/polynomial_regression)
- [Polynomial regression with MShadow library tutorial](https://github.com/Kolkir/mlcpp/tree/master/polynomial_regression_gpu)
- [Polynomial regression with Eigen library tutorial](https://github.com/Kolkir/mlcpp/tree/master/polynomial_regression_eigen)
- [Classification with Shark-ML machine learning library](https://github.com/Kolkir/mlcpp/tree/master/classification_shark)
- [Classification with Shogun machine learning library](https://github.com/Kolkir/mlcpp/tree/master/classification_shogun)
- [Classification with DLib machine learning library](https://github.com/Kolkir/mlcpp/tree/master/classification_dlib)
